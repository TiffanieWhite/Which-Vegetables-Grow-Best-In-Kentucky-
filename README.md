# Which-Vegetables-Grow-Best-In-Kentucky-

I decided to change me project to researching which vegetables grow best in Kentucky. My reasoning is I come from a crop farming background (my father's side and when I was much younger) and last year I tried my hand at patio/container gardening, but I was very much unsuccessful. I had a few tomato plants that produced probably about 20 cherry tomatoes and my watermelons stopped growing and producing which in turn made them ant food. This year I am researching and retrying in rememberance of my uncle who recently passed (to carry on the tradition) and because the food prices for my family of 4 which 2 are special needs who only eat certain vegetables has became astonomically high (especially since I have became unemployed). Not only is my goal to produce food for my home, but I am also hoping to have a little fruit/vegetable stand to get a little passive income.
